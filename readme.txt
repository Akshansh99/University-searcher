UNIVERSITY API SEARCHER

Description:
--> A simple API search site created using University Search API by hipolabs (http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?country=).

Design:
--> To implement the project Node.js, Express and Axios were used.
--> This project is created using two simple routes for search and retrieval of data.
--> These routes are "/" and "/results"
--> The user enters his query on home("/") and the API searches for the input and shows the output("/results).
--> Further we also print the official website which redirects to them.
